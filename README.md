# icons-in-terminal

## Overview

`icons-in-terminal` allows you to get any fonts in your terminal without replacing or patching your font.  
You can add as many fonts as you want easily, you just need the ttf/odf file and add it to `config.json`.  

## Install

To install the font, you need to modify `sample/icons.conf` and replace `YOUR_TERMINAL_FONT` with the name of your terminal font, for example "Droid Sans Mono".  
Then you can run:  

```bash
$ ./install.sh
```
Done ! You can start a new terminal and run `print_icons.sh` to see the installed gryphs.  

## Building

If you want to add new font, there are a few dependencies to install:  

- Python 3
- [fontforge (with python extension)](https://fontforge.github.io)

You can add the name and path of you font to the file `config.json`.  
You should add it at the end of `config.json` to avoid to shift all codepoints of the others font.  
Each font can take parameters:  
- `start-from`: exclude all glyphs before the given codepoint.
- `until`: exclude all glyphs at the given codepoint and after.
- `excludes`: exclude the given codepoints.
- `move-vertically`: Use this parameter if your font and its glyphs are not centered vertically.

Once done, you can run:  
```bash
$ ./build.sh
```
## How it works

This project is inspired by [awesome-terminal-fonts](https://github.com/gabrielelana/awesome-terminal-fonts) but is different.  
I don't modify any existing font, I create a new one and insert each glyphs from the provided fonts in the [private use areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Use_Areas).  
The file `icons.conf` tells to freetype to search the glyph in `icons-in-terminal.ttf` if it fails in your default font file. As the codepoints generated are in the private use areas, freetype should always fail and fallback to icons-in-terminal.ttf
